# 🤖 Empathetic Agent

An empathetic AI assistant designed to interact gently and supportively with women recently diagnosed with breast cancer. The agent's primary goal is to collect essential information while maintaining a warm, respectful tone — without initiating general conversation or casual dialogue.

## 📚 Project Overview

The Empathetic Agent is focused on gathering the following five pieces of information:
1. **First Name**
2. **Age**
3. **Type of Breast Cancer Diagnosis**
4. **Current Treatment Details**
5. **Support System (Family, Friends, Community)**

The conversation is designed to:
- Ask **one question at a time**.
- **Gently persist** if the user does not respond, rephrasing the question.
- **Limit retries to 3 times** per question.
- **Move on** if the user doesn't respond after 3 attempts.
- **Strictly avoid** casual conversation or open-ended discussions outside the required questions.
